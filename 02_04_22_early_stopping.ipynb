        "In machine learning, one of the critical aspects of training a model is ensuring that it generalizes well to new, unseen data. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, which negatively impacts its performance on new data. To prevent overfitting, various techniques can be employed, and one such technique is **early stopping**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Early stopping is a method where the training process is halted when the model's performance on a validation dataset stops improving. By doing so, we avoid over-training the model, thereby maintaining its ability to generalize well. This exercise focuses on implementing early stopping during the training of a machine learning model by monitoring the validation loss over epochs.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this exercise, you will simulate the training process of a machine learning model. You will use epoch performances, specifically validation losses, to determine when to stop the training. You will implement two methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Immediate Stop:** The training stops immediately when the validation loss increases compared to the previous epoch.\n",
        "2. **Patience:** The training stops if the validation loss does not improve for a specified number of epochs, known as patience.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this exercise, you will understand how to apply early stopping in a practical scenario, helping you enhance your model's performance by preventing overfitting. Let's dive into the details and start implementing these methods!"
