    "Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. It involves classifying text as positive, negative, or neutral based on the words and context. Sentiment analysis is commonly used to analyze customer feedback, social media posts, and product reviews to gauge public opinion and understand how people feel about a particular subject or entity."
