    "## Understanding Hyperparameters in Machine Learning\n",
    "Hyperparameters are settings or configurations that you set before the training process begins, which control the behavior and performance of machine learning models. Unlike model parameters, which are learned from the data during training, hyperparameters are predefined and must be set manually. They play a crucial role in model performance and can significantly impact the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Hyperparameters:\n",
    "1. Learning Rate: Controls how much to change the model in response to the estimated error each time the model weights are updated.\n",
    "2. Batch Size: Determines the number of training samples used in one iteration.\n",
    "3. Number of Epochs: Specifies how many times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset.\n",
    "4. Regularization Parameters: Help prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function.\n",
    "5. Momentum: Accelerates the gradient vectors in the right directions, leading to faster converging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importance of Hyperparameters:\n",
    "Setting the right hyperparameters is essential for model training because they directly influence the training process and the performance of the model. Proper tuning of hyperparameters can lead to better model accuracy, faster convergence, and overall improved results."

For example, a learning rate of `0.001` can be represented as `1ùëí‚àí3`."
